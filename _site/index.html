<p>This dataset explores how <strong>lifestyle habits</strong> — such as <strong>exercise</strong>, <strong>caffeine</strong>, <strong>alcohol</strong>, and <strong>smoking</strong> — affect <strong>sleep efficiency</strong>. Originally published on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melvillepais/capstone-1">Kaggle</a> in 2021, the data combines detailed <strong>sleep tracking</strong> information with daily <strong>behavioral patterns</strong> from anonymous individuals.</p>
<hr>
<section id="objective" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objective">🎯 Objective</h3>
<p>The goal of this analysis is to understand how everyday behaviors influence the quality of sleep, as measured by <strong>sleep efficiency</strong>.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="modeling-sleep-efficiency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modeling-sleep-efficiency">🔬 Modeling Sleep Efficiency</h3>
<p>We modeled <strong>sleep efficiency</strong> as a linear function of several lifestyle variables: - 🏋️‍♂️ <strong>Exercise Frequency</strong> - ☕ <strong>Caffeine Consumption</strong> - 🍷 <strong>Alcohol Intake</strong> - 🚬 <strong>Smoking Status</strong></p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="key-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings">📈 Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who <strong>exercise more frequently</strong> tend to have <strong>higher sleep efficiency</strong>.</li>
<li>Higher <strong>caffeine</strong> or <strong>alcohol</strong> consumption is generally linked to <strong>poorer sleep quality</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>every unit increase in exercise frequency</strong>, <strong>sleep efficiency improves by ~3%</strong> (±0.5%).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>💡 <strong>Insight:</strong> Regular physical activity appears to be the <strong>strongest predictor</strong> of better sleep in this dataset.</p>
