## 🛌 Sleep Efficiency & Lifestyle Habits

This dataset explores how **lifestyle habits** — such as **exercise**, **caffeine**, **alcohol**, and **smoking** — affect **sleep efficiency**. Originally published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melvillepais/capstone-1) in 2021, the data combines detailed **sleep tracking** information with daily **behavioral patterns** from anonymous individuals.

---

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to understand how everyday behaviors influence the quality of sleep, as measured by **sleep efficiency**.

---

### 🔬 Modeling Sleep Efficiency

We modeled **sleep efficiency** as a linear function of several lifestyle variables:
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Exercise Frequency**
- ☕ **Caffeine Consumption**
- 🍷 **Alcohol Intake**
- 🚬 **Smoking Status**

---

### 📈 Key Findings

- Individuals who **exercise more frequently** tend to have **higher sleep efficiency**.
- Higher **caffeine** or **alcohol** consumption is generally linked to **poorer sleep quality**.
- For **every unit increase in exercise frequency**, **sleep efficiency improves by ~3%** (±0.5%).

> 💡 **Insight:** Regular physical activity appears to be the **strongest predictor** of better sleep in this dataset.
