## ðŸ“š Data Source

This project explores how lifestyle and body-related factors affect **sleep efficiency**.  
The dataset includes details like sleep patterns, bedtime/wake-up times, and personal habits such as **caffeine, alcohol, smoking, and exercise**.  
I used **AI tools** for cleaning messy data, making visual plots, and applying models to find useful patterns.  
The data was collected from Kaggle and is part of a capstone project.
