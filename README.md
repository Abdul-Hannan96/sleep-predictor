# Sleep Efficiency and Lifestyle Analysis

This project explores how lifestyle habits such as exercise, caffeine consumption, alcohol use, and smoking affect sleep efficiency. Using a dataset originally distributed on Kaggle in 2021, we analyze the sleep behaviors of anonymous individuals based on detailed nightly records and personal habits.

The goal is to uncover which factors most strongly predict sleep quality and efficiency. We use statistical modeling to evaluate the strength and direction of relationships between these lifestyle habits and sleep efficiency. The findings may help inform healthy behavior changes to improve sleep.
