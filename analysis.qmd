```
<br>

This scatter plot shows how sleep duration (hours) and sleep efficiency (%) are related, separated by gender. Most people sleep between 6 to 9 hours, and the best sleep efficiency usually happens with 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Both male and female participants show similar patterns, meaning their sleep quality follows the same trend.

```
<br>

This box plot shows how often people exercise in a week and how it affects their sleep efficiency. People who exercise more days tend to have slightly better sleep quality. However, there is still a lot of variation, meaning not everyone who exercises more always sleeps better. Regular exercise seems to be linked with better sleep for many people.

## üö¨ How smoking habits relate to sleep quality?

  ) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)

plot3

```
<br>
This bar plot shows how much time people spend in each sleep stage based on their smoking status. Non-smokers tend to have better deep and REM sleep compared to smokers. Smoking seems to reduce the amount of deep and REM sleep, which are important for feeling rested. So, smoking may hurt sleep quality by affecting the balance of sleep stages.

This heatmap shows how different sleep and lifestyle factors are related to each other. Dark red means a strong positive connection, while dark blue means a strong negative one. For example, more awakenings are linked with lower sleep efficiency, while longer sleep is linked with better sleep efficiency. It helps us quickly see which habits might improve or harm sleep quality.
